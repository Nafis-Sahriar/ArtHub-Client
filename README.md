# ArtHub – A Digital Marketplace for Artists and Collectors

ArtHub started with a simple idea: talented artists deserve a better place to showcase and sell their work, 
and art lovers deserve an easier way to discover and collect unique pieces.

ArtHub was built to create a more modern experience where artists can focus on sharing their creativity and collectors 
can easily find artwork they genuinely love. From traditional oil paintings to digital illustrations, ArtHub provides a 
dedicated platform where art takes center stage.

The application is designed with a clean and modern interface, making the experience feel more like browsing a 
professional gallery than scrolling through a typical marketplace.

## Authentication & User Management

ArtHub uses Better Auth to provide a secure authentication system. Users can create accounts using email and password or sign in with their Google account.
When a user signs up using google OAuth, the platform automatically gives him the role of a buyer and a free subscription plan, which was done using Better Auth's database hook.

---

## Artwork Discovery Experience

Finding artwork is one of the most important parts of the platform, so special attention was given to search and filtering features.

Users can:

* Search artworks instantly with a debounced search system.
* Filter by category such as Oil Painting, Watercolor, Digital Art, and more.
* Set minimum and maximum price ranges.
* Sort artwork efficiently while prioritizing available pieces before sold items.

Searching and filtering are designed to be fast and responsive .

## Subscription & Payments

ArtHub integrates Stripe to handle subscription upgrades and any art purchases securely.

When a user purchases a new subscription plan, the platform automatically updates their session 
and interface without requiring them to log out and sign back in. The entire process feels smooth 
and immediate from the user's perspective.

Also when a buyer purchases an artwork, the system checks their subscription plan to ensure they have not exceeded their purchase limit. 
If the purchase is successful, the buyer's collection is updated, and the artist's sales data and overall platform revenue are updated in real-time.

---

## Support System

The platform includes a centralized support system where users can submit tickets whenever they need assistance.
Each ticket is automatically linked with the user's authenticated account information, reducing errors and improving security. 
Administrators can review incoming requests, track their status, and resolve issues directly from an admin dashboard.

## Why I Built This

ArtHub was created as a full-stack project to explore how a modern digital marketplace works in practice. The goal was not only to build an attractive user interface 
but also to solve real-world challenges such as authentication, role-based access control, subscription management, secure payments, image hosting, and dynamic data filtering.

The project combines a modern Next.js frontend with an Express and MongoDB backend to create a complete marketplace experience that is scalable, responsive, and user-friendly.
